### Hi, In order to get your website up and running I have coded everything your website will need. You can name more stuff that you need, but I have most of it done.

First Step
You are going to see a green button that says <> code. Click that button and click download ZIP. Click save on your computer and open up the urls that you have setup.

Second Step
Figure out the site you are going to upload this code on and when you have a site to buy a domain.
